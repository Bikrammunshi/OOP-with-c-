1. 	Create a class distance which stores a distane in feet and inches. Input 2 distance values in objects, add them, 
	store the resultant distance in an 
	object and display it.

	[Write the above program in two ways.
		a. Store the resultant distance in the calling object: C3.add(C1,C2)
		b. Return the resultant object C3=C1.add(C2)

2.	Create a class with an integer data member. Include functions for input and output in class. Count the number
	 of times each function is called and
	display it.

3.	WAP to count the number of objects in a class.

4.	WAp to swap two integers using pass by reference.

5. 	WAP to increment the value of an argument given to function.

6.	WAP which displays a given character, n number of times, using a function. When the n value is not provided, it 
	should print the given character 80 times. When both the character and n value is not provided, it should print '*'
	character 80 times.
		[Write the above program in two ways:- 
			-using function overloading.
			-using default arguments.]
