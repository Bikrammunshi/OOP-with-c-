1.  Create a class shape. Derive three classes form it; Circle, Square, Triangle. Find are of 
    each shape and display it using virtual function

2.  Create a class which stores employee name id and salary. Derive two classes from employee
    class; regular and part time the regular class stores DA , HRA and basic salary. The part
    time class stores the number of hours and pay per hour. Calculate the salary of a regular
    employee and a partime employee using virtual function.

3.  Create a class which stores account number, customer name and balance. Derive two classes from 
    Account class savings and current the savings class stores minimum balance the current
    class stores the overdue amount. Inchle member functions in the appropriate class for
        -deposit money
        -withdray money
        -dispplay balance
    Display data from each class using virtual function

4.  WAP to demonstrate use of pure virtual function and abstract base class.

5.  WAP to add two objects of distacne class. Oerload the operator > to compare two objects 
    and return the object with larger time value and display it. Overload the == operator to 
    compare and display whether two given objects contain same distance value.

6.  WAP to add two objects of time class. Overload the operator == to compare two objects and
    display whether they are equal or not.

7.  WAP to create a class time convert time(hh:mm:ss) into seconds integer value

8. WAP to create a class distance having data members km, meter, cm. User enters the distance in
    centimeters. Conver the distance in to km:mm:cm.
